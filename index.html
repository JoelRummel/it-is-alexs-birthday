<h1>It is Alex's birthday</h1>

<p id="msg" hidden="">
  Alex is an excellent brother and I am as excited as he for the arrival of his 20th birthday. This site serves as a dedication to Alex on his special day, whose importance to my life and development cannot be understated. In fact, I would go so far as to say that I owe my lifetime success to him.
